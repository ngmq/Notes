(a) Show that p < d + 1

Because U^{T} * U = I and V^{T} * V = I, U and V are othorgonal matrix of rank p. If p >= d + 1 then X has rank >= d + 1 which contradicts
to the fact that X has dimension N * (d+1) and thus its rank is at most d+1. Therefore p < d + 1.

(b) w_{lin} = V * L^{-1} * U^{T} * y    (1)

Consider X = U * L * V^{T} => X^{T} = V * L * U^{T}. 

Note that since L is diagonal, L^{T} = L.

Then X^{T} * X = V * L * U^{T} * U * L * V^{T} = V * L * L* V^{T}    (2)

Then X^{T} * X * w_{lin} = V* L* L*V^{T} * V* L^{-1]* U^{T}* y = V* L* U^{T}* y = X^{T} * y.

Therefore, X^{T} * X * w_{lin} = X^{T} * y

(c) Prove that w_{lin} is the minimum norm set of weights that minimizes E_{in}

What we have to prove is equivalent to the statement that w_{lin} is the "least norm solution" of the equation A * w = Z
in which A = X^{T} * X and Z = X^{T} * y. Knowing that, we can use the same technique for proving the least norm solution of undetermined equations as follows (See page 4 of https://see.stanford.edu/materials/lsoeldsee263/08-min-norm.pdf):

Consider any w that differs to w_{lin}. Consider the cross product of w - w_{lin} and w_{lin}. We will prove this product equals to 0 as follows:

(w - w_{lin})^{T} * w_{lin} 

= (w - w_{lin})^{T} * V * L^{-1} * U^{T} * y (Substitute (1) to this)

= (w - w_{lin})^{T} * V * (L * (L * (V^{T} * V) * L^{-1}) * L^{-1}) * L^{-1} * U^{T} * y (notice that the products inside three middle brackets are identity matrix)

= (w - w_{lin})^{T} * (V * L * L * V^{T}) * (L^{-1} * L^{-1}) * L^{-1} * U^{T} * y) (regroup the matrices)

= ( V * L * L * V^{T} * (w - w_{lin}) )^{T} * (L^{-1} * L^{-1}) * L^{-1} * U^{T} * y)

= ( X^{T} * X * (w - w_{lin} )^{T} * (L^{-1} * L^{-1}) * L^{-1} * U^{T} * y) (Substitue (2) to this)

= 0

Therefore, w - w_{lin} is othorgonal to w_{lin}. Thus w = w_{lin} + sigma where sigma = w - w_{lin}.

Pythagore theorem: ||w||^2 = ||w||^2 + ||sigma||^2 

=> ||w||^2 > ||w|| (dpcm).
