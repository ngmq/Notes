**Disclaimer: I am an atheist who likes to read about Vietnamese Buddhism in my free time. This post does not concern any other branches of Buddhism. If you find my understanding on Buddhism incorrect or different to yours, you are most welcome to leave your thoughts in the comment section below.**

As I was running in the park today, thinking about the future of AI, a question suddenly came to my mind: if the tales were true and Buddha could see through the past of anyone ever lived, where has the data about karma and past of every life on earth been stored?

According to Buddhism, nothing happens for no reason. Whatever someone thinks, says and acts leaves consequences on his future. Cause and Effect is the central idea of Buddhism that has set the ground for a large body of subsequent ideas to be developed. The person you are now is a result what you have done in your previous lives some hundreds years ago. Furthermore, if you follow the teaching of Buddha and practice Buddhism long enough, you will eventually have the ability to see through the past of not only yours but others as well.

Let's assume that the stories about Buddha, at least in Vietnamese Buddhism, were true. Since the Buddha could just look at a person and instantly knew about his previous lives, there must be some sort of an existing data storage center that is capable of storing that information and retrieving it efficiently. The data center has to be extremely scalable to constantly update new information of all beings on earth at a rate of knots.

Even with today's technology, storing that much data is an insurmountable problem, let alone retrieving from it. There is no way he could have built such a data center in 5th BC, and even if he could, there is no documented evidence that he ever did, so I think it's safe to assume that such a thing had already been built well before his time. The question is, where is it?. If what we learned about Buddhism is correct, then that means the technology of Big Data has been effectively invented thousands of years ago.

I will provide three hypotheses that I could think of as follows. Feel free to give your comments on them or your own theories.

1) We are the data center. Our past is encoded in our DNA.

2) Someone from future built it.

3) It has been built in other planet
